Please add the Airline\AirlineUAT.zip\SalesOrders\WebContent to the default web site\ Airline for the UI

Please add the Airline\SalesOrderUAT.zip\SalesOrderUAT to the default web site with alias as SalesOrderUAT and localhost with port 8080(becuase ui makes ajax call to localhost:8080/salesordeUAT).
